# Session History: Port Configuration

Date: 2025-08-15

## Working Directory
/home/myokoym/dev/web/webchessclock

## Overview
Changed Docker Compose port configuration to avoid conflicts with the shogiwebroom project, allowing both projects to run simultaneously in local development environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Docker Compose Port Configuration
Modified `compose.override.yaml` to change port mappings:
- **Web application port**: Changed from 3000 to 3001
  - Host port 3001 now maps to container port 3000
  - Access URL changed to http://localhost:3001
- **Redis port**: Changed from 6379 to 6380
  - Host port 6380 now maps to container port 6379
  - Allows Redis CLI access without conflict

### 2. Impact Scope
- Changes only affect local development environment
- `compose.override.yaml` is development-specific and doesn't affect production
- Container internal ports remain unchanged (3000 for web, 6379 for Redis)
- Production deployment configurations are not affected

## Technical Details

### Port Allocation Strategy
| Project       | Web App | Redis | Debugger |
|--------------|---------|-------|----------|
| shogiwebroom | 3000    | 6379  | 9229     |
| webchessclock| 3001    | 6380  | 9230     |

### File Modified
- `compose.override.yaml`: Added port mappings to avoid conflicts

## Benefits
1. Both projects can run simultaneously without port conflicts
2. Clear separation of services between projects
3. Easy to switch between projects during development
4. No impact on production configurations

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the new configuration with both projects running
- [ ] Update local development documentation if needed
- [ ] Consider creating a development environment setup guide

## Git Commit
```
fix: Change Docker Compose ports to avoid conflicts with shogiwebroom

- Web app port: 3000 -> 3001 (http://localhost:3001)
- Redis port: 6379 -> 6380
- Allows running webchessclock and shogiwebroom simultaneously
```

## Notes
- The change is isolated to development environment only
- Production deployments use different configuration files
- Internal container ports remain standard (3000, 6379)
